## Course Description

Welcome to the world of spatial analysis and geographic information systems (GIS). Throughout history, humans have relied on maps for information, and in today’s era of big data, spatial intelligence has become indispensable for making everyday decisions. Advanced technology now enables us to use GIS and spatial analysis to solve complex, location-based problems.

This course provides a conceptual understanding of GIS and practical, hands-on experience with GIS software applied to real-world planning practice and research. We will cover topics such as thematic mapping, projections, geoprocessing, spatial data management, and spatial analysis techniques applicable to urban and regional planning. The course culminates in a final project where students will independently manage a GIS-based project.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Use ArcGIS Pro and its tools to address planning-related problems.
2. Produce and interpret maps and communicate spatial information effectively.
3. Apply basic statistical and qualitative knowledge to spatialize urban and regional issues.
4. Independently propose, manage, and execute a GIS project.
5. Utilize online resources and documentation to learn advanced GIS techniques.

---

## Course Format

The course combines lectures and lab sessions to build conceptual knowledge and practical skills. 
- **Tuesdays**: Lectures introducing the week's material.
- **Thursdays**: In-class lab sessions focused on applying concepts.  
Labs will require access to **ArcGIS Pro**, provided through Cornell's institutional license. 

Students are encouraged to collaborate during labs but must submit individual work. Labs and assignments will be available on Canvas.
